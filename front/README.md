## Install

Running `mvn clean compile` will install **Node** and **NPM** locally and then install all required dependencies. It will also execute **Webpack**.

It's better to also have **Node** (>=v7.9.0) installed globally. In this case you can run `npm install` to install all required dependencies. You'll need **Node**  to be installed on your system.

## Run

If you have **Node** (>=v7.9.0) installed globally you can run `npm start` to start the **webpack-dev-server**. Then you'll find the webApp at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). The server configuration comes with HRM (Hot Reload Module) enabled.
